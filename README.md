Yet another ambitious project that will ~never see the light of day~ be added to my ongoing work.

### Roadmap
Ideally, this could be used to rapidly prototype entire relational schemas by allowing a user to define a schema in a GUI tool that will generate the whole relational database while abstracting away (as far as the end user should know) all the specfics between differing RDBMS setups. Initially, I'll be adding support for Microsoft SQL Server with no specfic version requirements (yet).

Here's a checklist/roadmap of features to be added/implemented in the future:
- [ ] (<-- YOU ARE HERE ) Add minimal MS SQL support
- [ ] Implement a GUI
- [ ] Flesh out the MS SQL support system
- [ ] Add MySQL support
- [ ] Add SQLite support
- [ ] Potentially add other RDBMS

It's unlikely that I'll add support for any NoSQL DBMS, but it's not necessarily something I'm against.

### Contributing
I'd love to get any help I can on the project. Feel free to open a PR if you have any good ideas.
